            <h3>Soup</h3>
            <p>When we’re looking for a comforting meal packed with vegetables, this easy veggie soup is where we turn.
                It’s made with a light tomato broth and adapts to all seasons. Feel free to use any seasonal vegetables
                you have on hand. This soup is so good, you will want a batch in the freezer at all times.</p>

            <h3>Salad </h3>
            <p>Salad recipes are my favorite way to showcase vibrant, in-season produce – fruits and veggies that are so
                good on their own that you don’t need to do much to make them into a delicious meal. On cold winter
                nights, I like to brighten up our dinner table with a big, colorful mix of root veggies and hearty
                greens. </p>

            <h3>Beefsteak </h3>
            <p>A beefsteak, often called just steak, is a flat cut of beef with parallel faces, usually cut
                perpendicular to the muscle fibers. In common restaurant service a single serving has a raw mass ranging
                from 120 to 600 grams. Beef steaks are usually grilled, pan-fried, or broiled.</p>
